# Machine-Learning-Project
Project I've done as a part of a AI/ML course under Finlatics. Contains 2 case studies and I've used my new knowledge on certain supervised and unsupervised learning models to analyze the situation and data given to me.
Attached is :
2 PPTs containing my insight and analysis
Code of my Machine Learning Models
2 Word Documents containing a description of the data
Tech Stack used:
Google Colab
Scikit Learn for ML models
